<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm currently a fourth year undergrad at Peking University (PKU), advised by [Prof. Wentao Zhang](https://zwt233.github.io/). My primary research interests lie in data-centric machine learning and its applications in large language models (LLMs). In particular, I focus on how high-quality data can be leveraged to enhance models’ generalization and logical reasoning abilities. I am also interested in how LLM agents can perform decision-making and reasoning in complex, dynamic settings.

Prior to this, I worked in Prof. Yitao Liang's [CraftJarvis](https://craftjarvis.github.io/) Team, committed to developing a generalist agent capable of mastering a wide range of tasks and challenges within the open-world Minecraft.

**Jingwen Deng\***, Zihao Wang\*, Shaofei Cai, Anji Liu, Yitao Liang

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10684) \| [**Project**](https://craftjarvis.github.io/SkillDiscovery/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='7at7KbUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC'></span></strong>
- We propose a self-supervised method, **Skill Boundary Detection (SBD)**, that segments unlabelled long videos into semantic aware skill-consistent parts by detecting prediction-error peaks.
- In Minecraft experiments, SBD significantly improves both short-term and long-horizon task performance, enabling effective use of diverse online videos to train instruction-following agents.
